# 🚀 Quick Start: Interest Scheduler Integration

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Created New Files
```
backend/
├── services/
│   └── interest.js              ✅ Interest processing logic
├── schedulers/
│   └── interestScheduler.js     ✅ Cron job scheduler
├── utils/
│   └── logger.js                ✅ Optional logging utility
└── .env.example                 ✅ Environment template
```

### 2. Updated Files
```
backend/
└── index.js                     ✅ Added scheduler initialization
```

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Verify Installation (Already Done!)
```bash
cd backend
npm list node-cron
# ✅ Should show: node-cron@4.2.1
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment
Add these lines to your `.env` file:

```env
# Test Mode: Run every minute
INTEREST_CRON_DEBUG=1

# Production Mode: Run at 3 AM daily (uncomment when ready)
# INTEREST_CRON_DEBUG=0
# FD_INTEREST_CRON=0 3 * * *
# SAVINGS_INTEREST_CRON=30 3 * * *

# Optional: Clean console output
SUPPRESS_GENERAL_LOGS=1
```

### Step 3: Start the Server
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

### Step 4: Verify Schedulers Started
Look for these lines in console:
```
✅ Interest schedulers initialized successfully

⏰ INTEREST SCHEDULERS INITIALIZED
============================================================
⚠️  DEBUG MODE: Interest processors set to run EVERY MINUTE
✅ FD Interest Processor: Scheduled at '* * * * *'
✅ Savings Interest Processor: Scheduled at '* * * * *'
============================================================
```

### Step 5: Wait and Watch
With `INTEREST_CRON_DEBUG=1`, you'll see logs every minute:

```
🚀 Starting daily FD interest processing...
💰 Credited LKR 1250.00 interest for FD 1 to account 101
✅ Daily FD interest processing completed!
📊 FDs Processed: 2
💰 Total Interest Credited: LKR 3,350.50
```

## ⚡ Quick Commands

### Test Now (Debug Mode)
```bash
# In backend/.env
INTEREST_CRON_DEBUG=1

# Start server
npm start

# Watch console for processing every minute
```

### Production Mode
```bash
# In backend/.env
INTEREST_CRON_DEBUG=0
FD_INTEREST_CRON=0 3 * * *
SAVINGS_INTEREST_CRON=30 3 * * *

# Start server
npm start
```

### Clean Logs (Optional)
```bash
# In backend/.env
SUPPRESS_GENERAL_LOGS=1

# Restart server
npm start

# Now only interest logs and errors will show
```

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

Run through this checklist to verify everything works:

- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] See "Interest schedulers initialized" message
- [ ] With DEBUG=1, processing runs every minute
- [ ] Interest logs show with emojis (🚀, ✅, 💰, etc.)
- [ ] Database transactions are created
- [ ] No crashes or errors
- [ ] Can switch to production schedule

## 📊 Expected Output

### On Server Start:
```
============================================================
🚀 B-Trust Microbanking System API Server
============================================================
📍 Server running on port: 5000
🌍 Environment: development
⏰ Started at: 2025-10-19T10:30:00.000Z
============================================================
✅ Database connection verified
✅ Interest schedulers initialized successfully

⏰ INTEREST SCHEDULERS INITIALIZED
============================================================
⚠️  DEBUG MODE: Interest processors set to run EVERY MINUTE
⚠️  Set INTEREST_CRON_DEBUG=0 in production!
✅ FD Interest Processor: Scheduled at '* * * * *'
✅ Savings Interest Processor: Scheduled at '* * * * *'
============================================================
```

### During Processing (Every Minute in Debug):
```
🚀 Starting daily FD interest processing (30-day per-account cycles)...
💰 Credited LKR 1250.00 interest for FD 1 to account 101
💰 Credited LKR 2100.50 interest for FD 3 to account 103
✅ Daily FD interest processing completed!
📊 FDs Processed: 2
💰 Total Interest Credited: LKR 3,350.50
🏁 Matured FDs Processed: 0
💵 Principal Returned: LKR 0

🚀 Starting daily savings interest processing (30-day per-account cycles)...
💰 Credited LKR 150.25 interest for account 201 (Adult)
💰 Credited LKR 85.75 interest for account 205 (Children)
✅ Daily savings interest processing completed!
📊 Accounts Processed: 2
💰 Total Interest Credited: LKR 236.00
📅 Date: 2025-10-19
```

## ❌ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Schedulers don't initialize
```
❌ Failed to initialize interest schedulers
```
**Solution:** node-cron is already installed, so check:
1. File paths are correct
2. No syntax errors in scheduler files
3. Restart the server

### Problem: No processing happens
**Solution:** 
1. Set `INTEREST_CRON_DEBUG=1` to test every minute
2. Check database functions exist
3. Verify database connection is working

### Problem: Too many logs
**Solution:**
```env
SUPPRESS_GENERAL_LOGS=1
```

### Problem: Not enough logs
**Solution:**
```env
SUPPRESS_GENERAL_LOGS=0
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Emoji Indicators
These emojis mark interest-related logs (always shown):
- 🚀 Process starting
- ✅ Success
- 💰 Interest credited
- 📊 Statistics
- 🏁 Matured FDs
- 💵 Principal returned
- ❌ Error
- ⏰ Scheduler status
- ⚠️ Warning/Debug

### Cron Schedule Format
```
* * * * *
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ └─ Day of week (0-7, Sunday = 0 or 7)
│ │ │ └─── Month (1-12)
│ │ └───── Day of month (1-31)
│ └─────── Hour (0-23)
└───────── Minute (0-59)
```

### Environment Modes
- **DEBUG:** `INTEREST_CRON_DEBUG=1` - Every minute
- **PRODUCTION:** `INTEREST_CRON_DEBUG=0` - Scheduled times
- **CUSTOM:** Set specific cron expressions

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
1. ✅ Server starts without errors
2. ✅ Scheduler initialization messages appear
3. ✅ Processing runs on schedule
4. ✅ Interest transactions appear in database
5. ✅ Emoji logs are visible and clear
6. ✅ No crashes or errors

## 🎉 You're Done!

The interest schedulers are now fully integrated and running. 

**Next steps:**
1. Test in DEBUG mode (every minute)
