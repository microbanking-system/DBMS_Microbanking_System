# Account Creation Stepper Implementation

## Date: October 18, 2025

## Overview
Successfully implemented a 3-step stepper process for the Account Creation flow in the B-Trust Microbanking System. This improves user experience by breaking down the account creation process into logical, manageable steps with clear visual feedback.

## Implementation Details

### Stepper Steps

1. **Step 1: Customer Selection**
   - Select the primary account holder
   - Search functionality for finding customers by name or NIC
   - Display customer details and age validation
   - Auto-select appropriate plan based on customer age
   
2. **Step 2: Account Details**
   - Choose saving plan (age-appropriate options)
   - Select branch
   - Enter initial deposit
   - Add joint account holders (if Joint plan selected)
   - View account summary preview
   
3. **Step 3: Confirmation**
   - Review all entered information
   - Display customer information
   - Show joint holders (if applicable)
   - Display account details summary
   - Show branch information
   - Final submit action

### Technical Components

#### New State Variables
```typescript
const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState<1 | 2 | 3>(1);

const steps = [
  { number: 1, label: 'Customer Selection' },
  { number: 2, label: 'Account Details' },
  { number: 3, label: 'Confirmation' }
];
```

#### Validation Functions
- **validateStep1()**: Validates customer selection and age requirements
- **validateStep2()**: Validates account details, plan selection, deposit, and joint holders
- **validateForm()**: Combines both validations for final submission

#### Navigation Functions
- **handleNextStep()**: Advances to next step after validation
- **handlePrevStep()**: Returns to previous step without validation
- **resetForm()**: Clears all form data and returns to Step 1

#### Visual Components
- **CheckIcon**: SVG checkmark for completed steps
- **Step Circles**: Shows current progress (inactive, active, completed states)
- **Step Lines**: Connecting lines between steps (completed/incomplete)
- **Step Labels**: Text labels below each step

### UI Components

#### Stepper Visual States

**Step Circle States:**
- **Inactive** (gray): Future steps not yet reached
- **Active** (blue with glow): Current step user is on
- **Completed** (green with checkmark): Steps already completed

**Step Lines:**
- **Incomplete** (gray): Connection to future steps
- **Completed** (green): Connection between completed steps

#### Navigation Buttons

**Step 1 Buttons:**
- "Clear Form" - Resets entire form
- "Next: Account Details →" - Advances to Step 2

**Step 2 Buttons:**
- "← Back" - Returns to Step 1
- "Review & Submit →" - Advances to Step 3

**Step 3 Buttons:**
- "← Back to Edit" - Returns to Step 2 for modifications
- "✓ Create Account" - Submits the form

### CSS Styling

#### Stepper Container
```css
.stepper {
  padding: var(--spacing-lg);
  background: var(--bg-white);
  border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-color);
  margin-bottom: var(--spacing-lg);
}
```

#### Step Circle Dimensions
- Width/Height: 40px (desktop), 36px (mobile)
- Border radius: 50% (perfect circle)
- Border: 2px solid (color varies by state)

#### Active Step Glow Effect
```css
.step-circle.step-active {
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px rgba(26, 54, 93, 0.2);
}
```

#### Confirmation Section
- Background: Light gray (var(--bg-primary))
- Border-left: 3px solid primary color
- Padding: Compact spacing for dense information display

### Responsive Design

**Mobile Adaptations (<768px):**
- Stepper layout changes to vertical
- Step lines hidden on mobile
- Font sizes reduced
- Detail rows stack vertically
- Smaller step circles (36px vs 40px)

### User Experience Improvements

#### Progressive Disclosure
- Only shows relevant fields for current step
- Reduces cognitive load
- Prevents overwhelming users with all fields at once

#### Visual Feedback
- Clear indication of current position in process
- Completed steps marked with green checkmarks
- Active step highlighted with blue glow
- Inactive steps grayed out

#### Error Handling
- Validation occurs before advancing to next step
- Errors displayed inline with context
- Can navigate back to fix errors
- Form data preserved during navigation

#### Confirmation Review
- Comprehensive summary before submission
- Organized into logical sections
- Clear labeling of all entered data
- Easy to spot mistakes before final submission

### Form Flow Logic

```
Start → Step 1 (Select Customer)
         ↓ [Validation]
         ↓ [Next Button]
         ↓
       Step 2 (Enter Details)
         ↓ [Validation]
         ↓ [Next Button]
         ↓
       Step 3 (Review & Confirm)
         ↓ [Final Validation]
         ↓ [Submit Button]
         ↓
       Success → Reset to Step 1
         OR
       Error → Return to Step 2
```

### Key Features

#### Smart Navigation
- Can't advance without passing validation
- Can go back freely without losing data
- Clear form resets everything and returns to Step 1

#### Data Persistence
- Form data maintained across step navigation
- Selected customer preserved
- Joint holders list retained
- All inputs saved during step changes

#### Post-Submission Behavior
- On success: Shows success message, resets form to Step 1
- On error: Shows error alert, returns to Step 2 for corrections
- Scrolls to top to ensure success message visibility

### Benefits

- **Less Overwhelming**: Focus on one task at a time
- **Fewer Mistakes**: Validation at each step prevents errors
- **Better Overview**: Confirmation step catches mistakes before submission
- **Faster Completion**: Logical flow reduces confusion

#### For System
- **Better Validation**: Step-by-step validation catches errors earlier
- **Cleaner Code**: Separated validation logic for each step
- **Maintainability**: Easier to modify individual steps
- **User Tracking**: Can analyze where users spend time or drop off

## Code Statistics

- **New Functions**: 4 (validateStep1, validateStep2, handleNextStep, handlePrevStep)
- **New State Variables**: 2 (currentStep, steps array)
- **CSS Classes**: 20+ new classes for stepper styling

## Validation Rules

### Step 1 (Customer Selection)
- ✅ Customer must be selected
- ✅ Customer age must meet plan requirements (if plan already selected)

### Step 2 (Account Details)
- ✅ Saving plan must be selected
- ✅ Branch must be selected
- ✅ Initial deposit must be non-negative
- ✅ Initial deposit must meet minimum balance requirement
- ✅ Joint accounts require at least one joint holder
- ✅ Joint holders must be at least 18 years old

### Step 3 (Confirmation)
- ✅ All Step 1 validations pass
- ✅ All Step 2 validations pass

## Known Limitations

1. **No Draft Saving**: Form data lost if user navigates away
2. **No Step Skipping**: Must go through steps sequentially
3. **Single Session**: Can't resume interrupted account creation
4. **No Undo**: Submit action is final (but has confirmation step)

## Accessibility Considerations

- ✅ Clear visual indicators for current step
- ✅ Descriptive button labels
- ✅ Keyboard accessible (tab navigation works)
- ✅ Color contrast meets WCAG standards
- ⚠️ Could add ARIA labels for screen readers
- ⚠️ Could add keyboard shortcuts for step navigation
